The **Management Portal** is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS for the front-end, and Python with the Django framework for the back-end. It serves as a comprehensive **student-teacher portal**, enabling efficient management of academic interactions. The portal allows **teachers** to upload course materials, assign tasks, and track student performance, while **students** can access study resources, submit assignments, and view their grades. The project focuses on improving communication between students and teachers, streamlining administrative processes, and providing a centralized platform for academic management.
